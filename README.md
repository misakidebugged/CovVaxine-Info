# CovVaxine-Info
Luc Misaki Makelele here with a Simple Jetpack Compose Android App Template.
This is a WIP and was made for the GADS 2021 Community Project.

## What is CovVaxine Info?

It basically a health app aimed to combat mis-information concerning COVID-19 Vaccines.
It provides relevant information about each vaccine including their side-effects and dosage usage.

Here is the general look of the app:

I found it very hard to get bite sized friendly information about vaccines and felt the need to create this app
I hope to improve its functionality in the future such as

1. Adding Vaccination Spots Near the User
2. Helping users evaluate what vaccine is best for them
3. Add non WHO approved vaccines.

Contributions to the app are highly welcome.
Thanks for checking it out.
A Downloadable APK will be added ASAP.
